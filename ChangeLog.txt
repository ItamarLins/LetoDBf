  * include/letocl.h
  * source/client/client1.c
  * source/client/clientcl.c
    * move changed-record update call [ --> leto_PutRec() ] into letoSkipRaw(),
      so all these calls are in client1.c, only except for record appending;
      added reset of pending relations
    - remove relicts of ugly FastAppend hack, it led to serious problems in
      multiple areas ( memo update, locks tracking, autoincrement fields, .. );
      a transaction can be used instead for a similar effect
    + added field type HB_FT_ANY for transactions ( untested );
    ; ToDo ?: updated memo fields in transaction buffer, difficult :-(
